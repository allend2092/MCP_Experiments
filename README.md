# MCP Experiments

This repository contains experiments and prototypes using the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose local infrastructure tools
to large language models.

Initial focus:
- Running an MCP server on a Raspberry Pi
- Exposing read-only network tooling (Cisco IOS)
- Consuming tools via Open WebUI and a local LLM
