# Configuration Artifacts

This directory contains transport and security configuration
used by the MCP server.

Notably:
- ssh_config: scoped legacy SSH allowances for old devices
- known_hosts: pinned host keys (optional but recommended)

These files are intentionally version-controlled to ensure
portable, deterministic behavior across environments.
